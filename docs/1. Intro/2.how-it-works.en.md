# How Does It Work?

## Principle of Operation

| Description | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| Spline Architect allows creating walls and buildings by arranging modular meshes along a spline. Meshes at corners are generated dynamically and can be either straight or curved. | ![img](assets/simple-wall-example.gif) { width="200px" } |
| Floor meshes are also generated dynamically and uniquely for each `SplineArchitectWall`. | ![img](assets/floor-mesh.gif) { width="200px" } |
| Generation occurs in the `SplineArchitectWall` actor, inside the `OnConstruct()` function. This happens every time the actor is loaded unless the structure is baked. | ![img](assets/baked-disabled.gif) { width="200px" } |
| When baked, all “one-time” meshes are converted into regular `StaticMesh` components, and the actor no longer executes any logic when loading. | ![img](assets/baking-components.gif) { width="200px" } |
| Baked components can be modified manually, and changes will persist until the `SplineArchitectWall` is baked again. | ![img](assets/modifying-components.gif) { width="200px" } |
| During baking, `StaticMesh` assets for corners and floors are created. These meshes are saved with consistent naming and reused across different structures whenever possible. | ![img](assets/baked-assets.jpg) { width="200px" } |

## Important Details

| Description | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| Spline Architect expects your modular meshes to be configured as follows:<br>- Their length is aligned along the X axis<br>- Pivot point is centered on X and Y axes and at floor level on Z axis | ![img](assets/pivot-example.jpg) { width="200px" } |
| All `SplineArchitectWall` actors must be baked before packaging the game; otherwise, meshes will not appear in the packaged game. | ![img](assets/bake-methods.jpg) { width="200px" } |
